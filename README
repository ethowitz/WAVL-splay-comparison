This repository contains implementations of a standard binary search tree, a
splay tree, and a WAVL (weak AVL) tree. It also contains a suite of tests that I
designed to gauge the relative performance of the three trees. Everything is
written in Python 3, and the only thing you need to do to run the tests is type
"python test_suite.py".

Here is a link to the analysis of the results I found:
